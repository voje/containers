# Openstack exporter
Uses gophercloud (golang openstack client).   
We need access to the cloud and correct credentials and information 
about projects, domains and regions.   
Set `clouds.yaml` and run `./run.sh`.   
Run this on a machine that can ping Openstack's internal networks.   

## Grafana dashboard
Google it and import via ID.
